## 📁 Project Files

- `ipl data analysis.py` – Main Python script containing:
  - CSV data loading
  - IPL data analysis through interactive menus
  - Graph generation and visualizations

- `matchanalysis.csv` – Required dataset (not included here, place in same directory)

---

## 📌 Features

### 🧾 Main Functionalities:
- Read and display IPL CSV data
- View full dataset or selective rows/columns
- Perform custom IPL data analysis:
  - Matches per season
  - Toss statistics
  - Winning stats (by runs/wickets)
  - Player of the match trends
  - Summary statistics

### 📈 Visualization Options:
- Line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts
- Toss decision frequency
- Most successful teams
- Player of the match histogram
- Venue-wise match count

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

Install required libraries with:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

### ▶️ Run the Project

Ensure `matchanalysis.csv` is in the same directory and run:

```bash
python "ipl data analysis.py"
```

## 📝 Data Format

The script expects a CSV file (`matchanalysis.csv`) with IPL match data.  
Ensure it includes columns like:

- `season`, `winner`, `toss_winner`, `venue`, `win_by_runs`, `player_of_match`, etc.
